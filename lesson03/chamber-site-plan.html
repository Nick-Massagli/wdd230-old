            <h3>Site Plan</h3>
            <p>The chosen name for this site is KentChamberCommerce.org. This name was chosen as it is a clear representation of what the site is, who it is for, and how it is used.</p>

            <h3>Site Purpose</h3>
            <p>The Kent Chamber of Commerce strives to unify our diverse community, and lend opportunity to the many small business owners in the area. We also hope to provide Information
                to the public on our services.  This site aims to hit both of those goals, as a hub of information and library of readily available resources.</p>

            <h3>Scenarios</h3>
            <li>
                <p>Who are the partners of this chamber?</p>
                <p>Where can I find info about advertising?</p>
                <p>What are the benefits of membership?</p>
            </li>

            <h3>Color Schema</h3>
            <p>Primarily, the site will utilize greyscale for most backgrounds and text, however color is important to make visuals pop, and so Blue #59737f will be used for headings, \
                and Blue #1e5f7c as an accent color. These colors are representative of the Great Pacific Northwest, and not too loud, as to not distract from the purpose of this site.</p>

            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <p>The font used will be Raleway from the Google Fonts API. I feel this is a sleek and modern font that is easy to read, and fits the overall tone of the Chamber.</p>
